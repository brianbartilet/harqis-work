# HARQIS Work

## Introduction

* This is a real-world project for [HARQIS-core](https://github.com/brianbartilet/harqis-core), integrating multiple applications and automation layers.
* Demonstrates **RPA-like capabilities**, but implemented entirely in Python with Celery, n8n, and AI-driven workflows.
* Provides an extensible portfolio of automated routines for business, productivity, and personal systems.

## Getting Started

### **Setup and Installation**

Runs on **Python 3.12+**.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/brianbartilet/harqis-work.git
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies (from HARQIS-core):

   ```sh
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

### **Application Setup**

App- and workflow-level configuration lives under `workflows/` and `configs/`.

Documentation will be expanded as components mature.

## Mapping Files (Concise Overview)

HARQIS uses lightweight **JSON-like mapping files** to define actions, jobs, and command bindings.
These mappings allow **n8n**, **AI agents**, and **automation runners** to read structured instructions without loading full Python modules.

### **Purpose**

* Provide **mountable configuration** for n8n Docker workflows.
* Allow **AI assistants** (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.) to parse available actions deterministically.
* Expose task definitions, commands, schedules, and arguments in a simple, machine-readable form.

These files are mounted into n8n (or any orchestrator) so external agents can decide which Celery tasks or scripts to run.

### **Format**

Mappings use a predictable **JSON-like dictionary structure**, e.g.:

```text
{
    'run-job--example_task': {
        'task': 'workflows.module.tasks.example_task',
        'schedule': <crontab: */10 * * * *>,
        'args': ['PARAM'],
        'kwargs': {}
    }
}
```

Another example (command runner):

```text
{
    'command-run--open_notepad': {
        'cmd': 'notepad'
    }
}
```

* Keys follow: `run-job--<name>` or `command-run--<name>`
* Values contain only literal fields:
  **task**, **cmd**, **args**, **kwargs**, **schedule**, depending on type.

### **Auto-Generation**

* **`workflows.mapping`** is **automatically generated** by a Celery management job.
* **`scripts.mapping`** or **`commands.mapping`** may be manually maintained or generated by small helper scripts.
* Regeneration overwrites previous content, ensuring schedules and paths stay in sync with source code.

These files are *not* meant to be edited directly unless you are adding new commands.
